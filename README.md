# Exciting-Projects

It has been a while since I was now drown by school and start developing fun projects without stress or being graded.
I want to use this repo as a space for my imagination!
Follow me on creating fun things and play around with code!
I have been meaning to experiment with p5.js, react, and more Python projects.
I'll see where the inspirations take me!
